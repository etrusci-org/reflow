# Reflow

A helper tool to change your habits.  
Created upon request.

---

## Usage

1. Decide on a habit change.
2. Create timer.
3. Do stuff the in the cycle time you've set yourself.
4. Never give up.

### Example

Let's say you want to start to drink water more often.

1. Click **+++** to add a timer.
2. Change the label to `i drank water`.
3. Enter `30m` as cycle target time.  
   If you enter a valid target time, the audio alert volume option will become visible.
4. Drink a sip of water.
5. Click **start**.
6. Whenever you drink water, click the **new cycle** button.

**Cycle target time input format**:
The format is: `Xd Xh Xm Xs`.  
`X` must be a positive integer followed by `d`, `h`, `m` or `s`.  
Separate multiple values with a space.  
You can ommit 0-values. E.g. `4h 30s` works too. Also just `300s`.
