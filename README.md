## Examples

### Create a new timer

Let's say you want to start to drink water more often.

1. Type `i drank water` into the **Identifier Label** field.
2. Type `30m` into the **Cycle Target Time** field.
3. Leave the **Audio Alert Volume** slider at `1.0`.
4. Click the **create** button.

    *A timer should have been now created. You can hover over the individual elements to get more information about them.*

5. Drink a sip of water. Then, click the **!** button to start the timer.
6. Whenever you drink water, click the **+** button to start a new cycle.

### Import a timer set

You can create multiple timers at once. Just write down your favorite timers in a text file to copy & paste them later.

Here's an example set you can try:

    Hydrate:30m
    Hello cruel world
    Audio Alert Test:10s:1.0
    Quieter Audio Alert:10s:0.3
